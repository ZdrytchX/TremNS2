Medpack Changes:
Refilehooked voiceover.lua and whited out the Come'On! taunt sound since i need to pack that sound properly
Voiceover also uses Nin's medpack patch for SiegeSimple, however it is modified
so it will request a medpack anyway if the user is low on resourceselse it will say nothing.
There is a cooldown of 10 seconds for medpack use so it cannot be spammed easily.
It is planned that instead of occuring a cost, a one-time use medpack that is restored
at the armoury will be used similar to tremulous.

Catpack cost 3 -> 5

17-01-12

240 -> 280hp, 205 -> 185 armour
Tunnel Entrance mature health increased 350 -> 380 so it doesn't die in two rifle clips
Tunnel entrance point value 5 -> 15 (effects scores only)
