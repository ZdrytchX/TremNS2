Natural Selection 2 Gameplay Modification with Quake 3 physics, Tremulous alike
balancing, and various improvement to the stock NS2 gameplay mechanics.

Feel free to contribute to this project by creating issues, making pull requests
for bug fixes and the alike. Just note that I do plan on keeping this as close
as possible to Tremulous gameplay. I don't have any plans to make this a true
successor to the Tremulous game due to UWE licensing selfishness (take a look
at what happened to NS2: Combat) but if I do end up going far enough to consider
the mod a standalone. I will likely choose one that will make this a free open
sourced shooter. I'll need Timbo's permission if I want to go any further than
that.
